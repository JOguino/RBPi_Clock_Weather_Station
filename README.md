# RBPi_Clock_Weather_Station

# Bedside Weather Station

Internal (Sensor)/ External (API) temperature, pressure, humidity, real clock time.

The Bedside Weather Station project displays the weather information such as temperature, humidity, pressure and successive weather display of the day.

This is a complete Raspberry Pi weather system with just the base Raspberry Pi hardware, and some assorted analog and digital sensors to make our measurements. No buying pre-made anemometers or rain gauges â€” we are making our own!

Each of those sensors uses different type of python or even C code to get the readings. Both of them store the results in the database in pretty much the same way. Generally speaking, the code works as follows. In the first run, it creates a new table and with setting up a ?, this process is repeated every ? minutes. This way you get a nice overview of the temperatures during the day.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
